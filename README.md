# System Optimizer Web Application

## Setup
1. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Update .env file with your database credentials
5. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
6. Run server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Development
- Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Run tests: `python manage.py test`

# System Optimizer Web Application

## Project Overview
A Django-based web application that provides system optimization and monitoring capabilities, combining system-level optimization with a user-friendly web interface.

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Infrastructure
- Django project structure established
- PostgreSQL database configured and running
- Custom User model with optimization preferences
- Core models implemented and tested:
  - SystemMetrics (system performance data)
  - OptimizationProfile (user optimization settings)
  - OptimizationResult (optimization outcomes)
  - SystemAlert (system notifications)

### Database & Models
- All models successfully migrated
- Test data created and verified
- Model relationships tested and functioning
- JSON field handling implemented for flexible data storage

### Testing
- Basic test suite implemented
- Model tests passing
- User relationship tests successful
- Data integrity tests completed

### Current Features
- Admin interface configured
- Basic dashboard view implemented
- Test data visualization working
- User authentication integrated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. API Endpoint Implementation
   - RESTful API setup
   - Serializer creation
   - Authentication handling
   - CORS configuration

2. Integration of Existing Optimization Code
   - Port SystemOptimizer
   - Adapt ResourceMonitor
   - Integrate PatternAnalyzer
   - Configure background tasks

### Future Enhancements
- Real-time system monitoring
- Machine learning predictions
- Performance visualization
- Advanced optimization algorithms
- User preference learning

## Technical Details
- Python/Django backend
- PostgreSQL database
- RESTful API (pending)
- Async capability for system monitoring
- JSON-based configuration storage

## Development Notes
- Debug toolbar temporarily disabled
- CORS to be configured during API implementation
- Currently running in development mode
